# Library
This program is a basic library system, written on Portuguese and developed for educational purposes. The goal of the program is being able to register books/users and managing loans. Since it was created in a classroom setting, no database was used â€” the program stores data only while it is running.

# Observations
This project was developed with the purpose of learning C#, so there may be some mistakes or parts that could be implemented differently.
